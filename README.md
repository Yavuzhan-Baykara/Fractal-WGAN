# Fractal-WGAN
A custom implementation of a Wasserstein Generative Adversarial Network (WGAN) to generate fractal images. The project uses a unique approach to build the generator and discriminator models without relying on any deep learning frameworks. It serves as an educational resource for understanding the inner workings of GANs and their training process."
